# Assessment Objectives: A Grader's Guide

### How to Use
Each file in the assessment-objectives folder contains a checklist of the objectives assess the apprentices' learning of the topics.

As an example: "0.md" contains the things apprentices should demonstrate through "Assessment #0". If an apprentice fails to demonstrate proper understanding of the concept, they should receive feedback, from the grader, indicating that they need to put additional effort into meeting that objective.  In most cases, this will mean improving their submitted project, otherwise the apprentice may be required to submit an additional code challenge or write-up to prove that they have mastered the concept.
